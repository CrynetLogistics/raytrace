1  - project init
3  - added vector functionalities
9  - added planes
13 - created interface/abstract class for meshes to handle spheres
14 - meshes now handles planes
15 - fixed invert brightness issues
16 - added shadowing for meshes AND introduced ray class for tracing
18 - implemented multiple bounces for reflectivity and shadows
20 - fixes
23 - fixed artefacts due to epsilon error in Ray.h and Ray.cpp, renders now look great
25 - fixed headers, file inclusions, added test objects, lamp initialisation fixed, 5.9s rendertime
26 - additional rays added, 10.2s rendertime
28 - major improvements to tracing, added reflectivity settings to Meshes, recursive reflections handled, 9.0s rendertime
